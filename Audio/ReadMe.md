Here is the schematic for the audio amp, speaker, headphone jack and volume wheel. 

Due to the fact that the Raspberry Pi Zero W doesn't have an audio jack. I had to use the GPIO18 and GPIO19 to drive the audio on PWM0 and PWM1 respectively. The GPIO was set using the <b>pwm-2chan</b> Device Tree Overlay (see my config.txt file in this repo). At first I was getting an awful buzzing and humming sound on top of the audio. After some googling, I found <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/external-link.jspa?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FENUb4leJ_rM">This Video</a>. After a bit of a wait, it describes adding <b>audio_pwm_mode=2</b> to the <b>/boot/config.txt</b> file. This enables the sigma delta modulation on the pwm gpio. As soon as I added this to the config.txt file of my portable, the sound quality instantly improved ten fold, no other filter circuit needed.
